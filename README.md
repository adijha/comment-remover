Comment-Remover
===============

Little online comment remover to strip out the comments from your code.

I could not find anything online that allowed me to quickly paste a piece of code, click a button and then ctrl+a to select it again, so I made my own :)

As far as my testing goes it works with all the languages that use forward slashes as comments (i.e : it doesn't work with Ruby).
I'll probably get it to work with them :)

Hope you find it useful somehow.
